<h4>
Acknowledgments
</h4>

I'd like to thank my tutor Suzanna Akins for helping me style this portfolio. I learned so much from sites such as https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/ and https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries_ex.asp. I'd also like to thank Kelsey Iverson for inspiring me to become a web developer.
